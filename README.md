### Empirical insights on social trading

Value investing is perceived to be dicey for an investor who is inexperienced with the complexities of financial markets. Web 2.0 has brought the world of social media, and it has changed the way people connect, communicate and share their ideas. Social trading can be a preferred, convenient way to minimise risk and maximise payoff for amateur traders. With the increasing disposable income, the more people will look out for opportunities to invest their money. Social trading, by its concept, looks promising. In this research, we will attempt to understand its potential and derive quantitative insights about the activity.

Our research will focus on answering the following questions:

- <u>Social trading as a successful option</u>

We will try to understand whether an average user in the social trading platform can make better returns than the average market payoff.

- <u>Factors leading to an investor identifying and copying another investor</u>

What are the factors that influence an investor to identify and copy another investor. It can be their portfolio returns, number of people already copying them or any other factor.

- <u>Geographical distance</u>

Another interesting question around social trading is that whether they have successfully broken geographical boundaries. We will also look into trading patterns of people from different geographies to identify common behaviour.

- <u>Predicting the likelihood of copying a portfolio</u>

We will attempt to model the copying behaviour of investors. The model will be expected to predict the likelihood of investment activity on a time interval. Additionally, we will try to predict the portfolio that will be copied by the given investor on the time interval.

The research will begin with an exploratory analysis of the dataset. We will try to take new questions or insights that might come up during the analysis.
